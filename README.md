# CryptoApp

In this project I was looking to make a fetch and use it in my components. I decided to do it with the Coingecko API 
which gives me all the information about the cryptos that are in their database.

I used Vite, ReactJS and the CSS preprocessor: SASS.

It took me 6 days to finish it. I usually design the app in Figma and then start working on the code.
